This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting whether a breast mass is benign or malignant based on cell nuclei measurements. The model is built using Logistic Regression and is deployed as a Streamlit web application.

The app allows users to input measurements using interactive sliders and provides real-time predictions along with a radar chart for better visualization of the input data.

Features

*Logistic Regression Model: Predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant.
*Interactive Streamlit App: Allows users to input data using sliders and visualizes the data using radar charts.
*Radar Chart: Displays cell nuclei measurements for mean, standard error, and worst values, comparing them visually.
*Probability Display: Shows the probability of the mass being benign or malignant.
